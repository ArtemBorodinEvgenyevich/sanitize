Sanitize History
================================================================================

Version 1.0.2 (2009-01-04)
  * Fixed a bug that caused an exception to be thrown when parsing a valueless
    attribute that's expected to contain a URL.

Version 1.0.1 (2009-01-01)
  * You can now specify :relative in a protocol config array to allow attributes
    containing relative URLs with no protocol. The Basic and Relaxed configs
    have been updated to allow relative URLs.
  * Added a workaround for an Hpricot bug that causes HTML entities for
    non-ASCII characters to be replaced by question marks, and all other
    entities to be destructively decoded.

Version 1.0.0 (2008-12-25)
  * First release.
